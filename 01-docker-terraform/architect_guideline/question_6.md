## Understanding Join, Multiple Join, MAX(), GROUP BY AND DATETIME HANDLING

Question 6 : For the passengers picked up in the zone named "East Harlem North" in November 2025, which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? 


### Note
Before we start to do the task, makesure you have upload the dataset for the task in postgreSQL via jupyter notebook or python script:
1. Green taxi trips data for November 2025: https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/green_tripdata_2025-11.parquet
2. Taxi zone: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv

If you have problem with uploading parquet file to postgreSQL, you can follow tutorial in the link below:

For csv file, you can follow tutorial in the link below:

### Guideline Tips And Trick
If you are reading this, I assume you have finished uploading the Green taxi trips data for November 2025 and Taxi zone to Postgresql.
If so, for the first step, make sure that the table for the data already exists in the Postgresql database.

To start querying, select the query tools menu at the top of the menu list, making sure that the query menu appears on the pgadmin display.

Alright, now let's get into the main discussion. As stated in the question above, we have to find the highest tip amount among the drop-off zones where the passenger was picked up from the “East Harlem North” zone in November 2025. To do this, we can use multiple joins and max() in SQL.

Multiple joins is a process where we will perform multiple joins on the same table.

For example:
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_1 AS abbreviation_table_1
JOIN table_2 AS abbreviation_table_2 ON abbreviation_table_1.id = abbreviation_table_2.id
JOIN table_3 AS abbreviation_table_3 ON abbreviation_table_1.id = abbreviation_table_2.id
WHERE condition;
```

Keep in mind that multiple joins can refer not only to different tables but also to the same table multiple times, as long as each join table has a different abbreviation.
The rest, once we can use multiple joins on tables, we just need to use MAX() and GROUP BY() to find the largest tip per zone and use DATE, TO_CHAR(), or time comparisons to filter data based on a specific time.

For example:
```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_1 AS abbreviation_table_1
JOIN table_2 AS abbreviation_table_2 ON abbreviation_table_1.id = abbreviation_table_2.id
JOIN table_3 AS abbreviation_table_3 ON abbreviation_table_1.id = abbreviation_table_2.id
WHERE TO_CHAR(datetime column, format datetime) = condition;
GROUP BY column_name
```
