How to answer:
```
# filter trip_distance kurang dari 100
df_lt_100 = df[df["trip_distance"] < 100]
# cari trip paling jauh
max_distance = df_lt_100["trip_distance"].max()
# ambil 1 baris data yang trip paling jauh
max_trip = df_lt_100[df_lt_100["trip_distance"] == max_distance]
# ambil tanggalnya
max_trip["lpep_pickup_datetime"].dt.date
```
