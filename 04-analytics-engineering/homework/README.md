# Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

If you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, what models will be built?

- `stg_green_tripdata`, `stg_yellow_tripdata`, and `int_trips_unioned` (upstream dependencies)
- Any model with upstream and downstream dependencies to `int_trips_unioned`
- `int_trips_unioned` only
- `int_trips_unioned`, `int_trips`, and `fct_trips` (downstream dependencies)

---

## **Answer of Question 1**

The answer is **`int_trips_unioned` only**

**Explanation**

When you use the **`--select`** (or shorthand **`-s`**) flag in dbt without any additional operators, dbt will **exclusively run the specific model** you have named.

# Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your `schema.yml`:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months. A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt test --select fct_trips`?

- dbt will skip the test because the model didn't change
- dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code
- dbt will pass the test with a warning about the new value
- dbt will update the configuration to include the new value

---

## **Answer of Question 2**

The answer is **dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code**
